**ACI python scripts using ARYA**

These are example python scripts that I use in my lab, generated using the ARYA utility (https://github.com/datacenter/arya).  All values are specific to my setup.  If you want to re-use, you will have to modify things to fit your setup.  

Note:  I use a credentials file to breakout authentication from the script itself.  Just modify the credentials file with your auth values and each script is set up to auto-reference those values.
